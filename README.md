## Purpose of this Repository
- Practice Python regularly
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build confidence with basic programming concepts
- Create a habit of consistency

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Online resources for learning and practice

This repository will grow as I continue learning.
Mistakes are part of the process, and improvement is the goal.
